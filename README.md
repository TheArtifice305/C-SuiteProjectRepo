# C-SuiteProjectRepo
Web dev project for C-Suite.

mainpage.py is where our main backend (python) code is at.

Within templates, we've got frontend with font edits, colors, and etc.
We've also got login and register working which, when successfully
operating, will take the user to the dashboard.
Posting is available now, complete with edit and delete. However,
it is not tied to user sign in yet.
Frontend work has been done.

Work in progress...
