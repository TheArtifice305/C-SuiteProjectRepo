# C-SuiteProjectRepo
Web dev project for C-Suite.

The entire code is situated in a folder called mainpackage.
This folder holds both our frontend and backend.

Python files are our backend work, while everything typically frontend can be found in templates.

Static holds any style or images used that you may find.

templates folder hold html files for register and login, which both work in logging in
and registering the user.

posts.html and new_post.html both hold code for the opportunities being shown and created.

edit.html holds code for editing the opportunites posted.

Files with the admin name in them all hold code for administration and partner
logins. This is structured to show different pages depending on the role of the user.

Documentation and a walkthrough is provided in the Markdown folder below mainpackage.

The project is currently in a "finished" state, but anyone is allowed and free to pick up where the developers left off.
